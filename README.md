# Symbolic General Relativity

This codes provides functions that allow us to calculate several GR tensorial objects such as the Christoffel symbols, the Riemann and Ricci tensors, and the scalar curvature. Additionally, it includes a function for performing a coordinate transformation of the metrics from a set of variables X to a set of variables Y.

For installation, only Python and SymPy are needed.

To use the code, all the functions are presented in the file GR_functions.py, which are then applied in Schwarzschild.py, spherical_coordinates.py, and ellipsoidal_coordinates.py. However, for a more "academic" explanation, please refer to the file GR_complete.ipynb.
